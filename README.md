This is my Project Exam 2. It is a venue booking and management site, based on the Noroff Holidaze API. 

## Description:

The project is based on the Noroff Holidaze API, and users can make the following actions:
- Create a new user
- Log in / out
- See the featured venue
- Search for venues
- See single venues
  - If users own venue, update or delete venue 
- Book venues based on availability  
- See profiles w/venues if venue manager
  - If looking at their own profile, a user might:
    - Update profile and sign up to be a venue manager
    - See their own bookings
